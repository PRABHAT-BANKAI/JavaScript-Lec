    <h1>Promise</h1>
    <p>
      A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is
      created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's
      eventual success value or failure reason.
    </p>

    <h2>3 State of promises</h2>
    <p>pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</p>
    <p>fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.</p>
    <p>rejected: meaning that the operation failed.</p>
